# Design notes

[Back to the README](../README.md)

Notes from the first version of the pipeline that still apply, plus the guardrails. For the current agent design see [agent_tools.md](agent_tools.md) and [how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md).

## The idea (written for version 1; the screen-then-judge split still holds)
Statistics find outliers, but a raw outlier is not an upcoder: some providers legitimately see sicker patients. Two jobs, two tools:
- **The statistical screen selects.** It uses the numeric signal, billed level versus what patient complexity predicts, to choose who gets a close look.
- **The LLM then reads and sorts.** For each selected provider it reads structured evidence (patient complexity, sample visits, and a records-review sample giving each sampled visit's documented level and minutes) and writes a cited summary with an advisory leaning (upcoding, high-acuity panel, or inconclusive). That leaning is what separates real upcoders from honest providers with sicker patients, and it decides which cases move on to the recovery packet. It does not set the flag, and it is not a verdict: people review the records.

In the live runs most of the separation came from the records-review evidence, not from the billing numbers alone. "Path A", an LLM judging from free-text clinical notes, is parked (see Roadmap); today's evidence is structured, not free text.


## Approach (version 1 pipeline)
1. **Baselines** - realistic E/M level mix for Family Practice in GA, from CMS's public *Medicare Physician & Other Practitioners - by Provider and Service* file (aggregated, no PHI).
2. **Synthetic data** - ~200 normal providers, 8 planted upcoders, 8 hard negatives (high 99215 share explained by sicker panels), with synthetic patients and claim lines, calibrated to the CMS distribution.
3. **Detectors** (the main metric is each provider's 99215 share):
   - *Baseline 1*: plain z-score of 99215 share against peers.
   - *Baseline 2*: risk-adjusted observed-versus-expected, using patient complexity (visit-weighted chronic-condition count).
4. **Flagging** - choose who goes to review: by default the top N (25), or every provider at or above a chosen suspicion level (`python src/flagging.py ... --min-suspicion 5`, with optional `--max-flagged` and `--min-claims`). A threshold flags fewer, better-targeted providers and cuts the number of AI calls; see `docs/threshold_sweep.md` for what each cutoff would flag.
5. **Case summaries (LLM)** - for each flagged provider, summarise the claims and patient complexity as `{decision_rationale, cited_claim_ids[]}`. The LLM does not set the flag (the screen does); it advises, and its advice gates the recovery packet.
6. **Guardrail** - rejects any summary citing claim IDs that don't exist for that provider.


## Baseline data caveats
`data/baselines/em_specialty_baselines.json` is built by `src/build_baselines.py` from the CMS file above. Read these before relying on it:
- **Small-cell suppression distorts the mix.** CMS hides provider-code rows with 10 or fewer beneficiaries, so low-volume codes drop out. Shares of higher codes are biased, and many providers show zero 99215 only because it is hidden. Treat the shares as biased, not as true billing mix.
- **Not a national sample.** The committed baseline covers all individual providers in five states (OH, NC, WA, GA, MI), not a random national draw. The GA Family Practice pull is the calibration target for the synthetic data.
- **Data year is unverified.** The JSON records `UNVERIFIED` until the release year is confirmed on data.cms.gov.
- **Office-visit codes only.** Established-patient 99211-99215; new-patient codes (99202-99205) are excluded.
- **Privacy.** NPIs are used only to group rows, then replaced by a discarded salted hash. Only aggregate distributions are saved; no provider-level rows.


## Evidence charts and case pages
`python src/evidence_chart.py data/synthetic reports/flagged.csv reports/charts` draws one SVG per flagged provider: boxes show how
the other providers' 99215 share varies at each patient-complexity level, and the provider is a point with a 95% Wilson interval
(thin levels are hollow and dashed). `python src/case_report.py CHECKED_SUMMARIES CHARTS_DIR OUT_DIR` builds a markdown page per
provider that combines the summary, its cited claims and the chart; see `experiments/261008_4_cc/cases/` for an example.


## Payment Integrity packet
`src/pi_packet.py` turns an "upcoding" case into draft material for the Payment Integrity team: a dossier, a reproducible sample of
claims to request records for, a sampling plan, and an overpayment estimator that extrapolates a reviewed sample with a confidence
interval. It does not draft letters or make findings. See `docs/payment_integrity.md`; worked examples (simulated review) are in
`reports/pi_packets/`.


## Guardrail scope
`src/guardrail.py` checks that every cited claim ID exists and belongs to the provider being summarized, and rejects summaries
with no citations. It does **not** check that a cited claim supports the sentence that cites it. For example, a summary could
call a visit "high-acuity" while citing a claim on a patient with no chronic conditions, and still pass. So 100% citation
accuracy means "no invented or misattributed claims", not "every statement is supported". Reviewers should treat the cited
claims as pointers to check. A lightweight support check (verifying numeric attributes a rationale states about cited claims)
has not been built.


## Repo layout (first version; see CLAUDE.md for the full map)
```
data/baselines/   CMS-derived specialty distributions (small, no provider-level rows)
data/synthetic/   generated providers, patients, claims (regenerated from a seed)
src/              baseline builder, data generator, detectors, summary step
eval/             eval harness and rubric
reports/          results and failure-mode write-ups
```


## Ground rules
- Synthetic data only. No real claims, no PHI.
- Never flag real, named providers, even from public data.
- Synthetic claims are cleaner than real ones, and patient complexity is a simplified proxy for documentation. Results don't transfer directly to production.
